Here you will find documents describing Hopac.  At the moment, the amount
of documentation is very limited, but hopefully this will improve shortly.

* [Programming in
  Hopac](https://github.com/VesaKarvonen/Hopac/blob/master/Docs/Programming.md)
  contains some discussion and examples on Hopac programming
  techniques. In the future, this document might grow to a proper
  introduction to Hopac.
* [Notes on the Internal Implementation of
  Hopac](https://github.com/VesaKarvonen/Hopac/blob/master/Docs/Internals.md)
  describes some aspects of the internal implementation of Hopac.  This
  document is not meant to be something that a user of Hopac would need to
  understand, but potential users might find this interesting
  nevertheless.
